## ü§ñ How to Test ALMA AI Assistant

ALMA is an intelligent AI assistant with built-in bias detection and reality anchors. Test these features while having natural conversations!

### 1. **Basic AI Conversation**
Try these starter messages:
- "Hello, I'm ALMA!"
- "What can you help me with?"
- "Tell me about artificial intelligence"
- "Help me solve a math problem"

### 2. **Query Counting & Reality Anchors**
- Send 5 messages to ALMA
- On the 5th message, you'll see a red response with a reality anchor
- Watch the query counter in the bottom-right corner
- Notice the tally marks in the bottom-left corner

### 3. **Bias Detection**
Try these sample messages to test different bias types:

#### Political Bias (Left)
```
"I think we need more progressive policies to address climate change and social inequality."
```

#### Political Bias (Right)
```
"We should focus on free market solutions and traditional values to solve our problems."
```

#### Emotional Content
```
"I'm feeling really sad and anxious about the current situation."
```

#### Absolute Language
```
"This is absolutely impossible and everyone knows it will never work."
```

### 4. **Echo Chamber Prevention**
- Have a 30+ second conversation about political topics
- After 25 seconds of political discussion, you'll see a viewpoint injection bubble
- The bubble shows an opposing perspective and fades away after 5 seconds

### 5. **Decision Brief Template**
- Ask complex questions like "Should we implement universal healthcare?"
- ALMA will provide a structured decision brief with:
  - What we know (Cited)
  - What we think (Inference)
  - What we don't know (Unverified)
  - How to find out (Next steps)

### 6. **Emotional Support**
- Use emotional language like "I'm depressed and need help"
- ALMA will detect the emotional content
- A modal will appear offering to connect you with real people
- You can choose to open email or messages apps

### 7. **Reality Anchors**
- Every 5 queries, you'll see reality reminders like:
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è REMINDER: I AM AN AI LANGUAGE MODEL ‚Äî NOT A HUMAN FRIEND."
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è WORDS, NOT THOUGHTS ‚Äî JUST PREDICTIONS."
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è I CALCULATE RESPONSES ‚Äî I DON'T "KNOW.""

### 8. **User Feedback**
- Click "Helpful" or "Not helpful" buttons on assistant responses
- This helps ALMA learn and improve over time
